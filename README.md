TREKR 
A place where friends can organize a group trip together
____________________________________________________________________

This is a group project consisting of three students attending Week 8 of General Assembly with a 2 week time period in which to create a functional app consisting of Ruby on Rails utilizing SQL database, specificallly Postgres.  TREKR will utilize a Google API and potentially a Yelp API. The app will be deployed live onto Heroku.

This idea came about from research into the travel market where we found there was a market opportunity for an online group travel application.  Headaches from planning group trips from back and forth emails and a need for having everything viewable in one location spawned our idea for TREKR.
